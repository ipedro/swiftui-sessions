# SwiftUI SDK Reference

This folder contains the SwiftUI and SwiftUICore module interface files extracted from the iOS SDK. These files serve as a comprehensive reference for all available SwiftUI APIs, types, and methods.

## Contents

- `SwiftUI.swiftinterface` - Main SwiftUI module interface
- `SwiftUICore.swiftinterface` - Core SwiftUI functionality interface

## What are Swift Interface Files?

Swift interface files (`.swiftinterface`) are textual representations of a module's public API. They show:
- All public types, methods, and properties
- Method signatures and parameter types
- Availability information (iOS versions, platform support)
- Generic constraints and type relationships

## Version Information

Current interfaces are from:
- **SDK Version**: iOS 18.1 Simulator
- **Swift Version**: 6.0 effective-5.10
- **Target**: arm64-apple-ios18.1-simulator

These interface files are invaluable for understanding the full scope of SwiftUI's capabilities and can help answer "what's possible?" questions during development.
